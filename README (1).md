# Chronic Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**
using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist in early
detection by analyzing patient medical data and identifying patterns
associated with chronic disease risk.

## 🎯 Objectives

-   Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
-   Handle missing values and categorical variables
-   Train and evaluate machine learning models
-   Predict chronic kidney disease

## 🗂️ Dataset

-   Kidney Disease Dataset (CSV)
-   Target Variable: CKD (Yes / No)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Jupyter Notebook
-   NumPy
-   Pandas
-   Scikit-learn
-   Matplotlib
-   Seaborn

## ⚙️ Workflow

1.  Data Loading
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis
3.  Data Preprocessing
4.  Model Training
5.  Model Evaluation
6.  Prediction

## 🚀 How to Run

``` bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
jupyter notebook
```

Run `Chronic disease prediction.ipynb`
